-- names for sessions
-- encode displayed buffer (hmmm it seems vte doesn't support that)
-- store in TermitTab only flags: SET_NAME, SET_FG_FONT, SET_BG_FONT, etc
values are already stored in VteTerminal, so we can simply read VteTerminal properties on demand
thus we can achieve smaller memory usage
